# Fortuna

Simple reminder app

## TODOs

- [ ] use more to figure out what needs doing next!
- [ ] open-next build failing, fix it!

## Longer term TODOs

- [ ] - add results page
- [ ] - add toasts (if we find need)
- [ ] - create a mobile app version converting this over to a monorepo
- [ ] either figure out ShadCN's Select or finish building a custom one, I don't like how hard it is to clear out the value... the one I have is too verbose and the set value doesn't show a nice display value but all caps value
- [ ] add DnD functionality to set urgency or for today by dragging to sifters (looks to be a little more tricky than I thought :( ). Try again with DnDKit
